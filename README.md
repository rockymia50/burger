 Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the the page -- waiting to be Eaten.

 Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move and be deemed eaten on the page.

* This app will stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
